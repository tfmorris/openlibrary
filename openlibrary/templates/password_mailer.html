Hello,

You (or someone claiming to be you) have requested us to reset your password.

In case you forgot your username, it is $:username.

If you want to reset your password, click the following link.

$:url(site + "/account/reset_password", username=username, code=code)

If you have not requested this, please ignore this mail. Nothing is changed in your account.

Thanks
