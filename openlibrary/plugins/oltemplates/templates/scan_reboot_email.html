Hello $scan_record.sponsor.displayname!

Thank you for your request of "$book.title" through the Open Library Scan-on-Demand service. We apologize for the delay of your request. The service is still in beta, and we are in the process of debugging the workflow. Your request is helping us make our system better. Unfortunately, the end result for you is there is a delay.

We have discovered the following reasons why delays are occurring:

1. The book is not on the physical library shelf (library catalogs, in general, do not necessarily correlate exactly to physical holdings).

2. The book is located in the Rare/Special collections department and will require extra examination and handling time.

3. The size/condition of the book does not allow it to be scanned.

4. The book is in microformat and cannot be scanned at the present time.

This email is to notify you that we have worked to improve our service based on what we have learned . It is possible that your book is in the Rare/Special collections department and can still be scanned. We would like to give you the opportunity to re-request your book at this time. Otherwise, your request will be cancelled.

Thank you for your support,

The Open Library Team
