$var subject: You've forgotten your password?

Hi $username,

We were informed that you've forgotten the password on your Open Library account. Not to worry, it's easy to reset.

Just click on the link below - that will take you to the reset page:

http://openlibrary.org/account/password/reset?username=$username&code=$code

If you didn't request to reset your password, you can disregard this email, and apologies for the interruption.

Regards,
The Open Library Team
