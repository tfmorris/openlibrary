Setting up a dev instance
=========================

Setting up an Open Library dev instance requires installing some third-party 
software and python modules. This document will step you though the 
installation process.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The Open Library dev instance has been tested on the following platforms.

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04
* Mac OS X Snow Leopard (with `XCode`_ and `homebrew`_ installed)

Make sure you have at least 1GB of RAM on your dev machine or virtual machine.

.. _XCode: http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html
.. _homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Getting the source
------------------

Open Library uses ``git`` for version control and the `code repository`_ is
hosted on github.

.. _code repository: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary

You can get the source code from there using::

   $ git clone git://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary.git
   $ cd openlibrary

This will create a directory called openlibrary with the entire
codebase checked out.

In case you don't have git installed already, you can install it on Ubuntu using::

    $ sudo apt-get install git-core
    
and on Mac OS X using::

    $ brew install git

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

Open Library depends a lot of third-party programs.

To install all the dependencies::

    $ sudo ./scripts/install_dependencies.sh

Note that this is run as root.

See :doc:`appendices/dependencies` for the list of dependencies.

Setting up the dev instance
---------------------------

Once all the dependencies are installed the dev instance can be setup by running::

	$ make bootstrap
	
This will do the following tasks, each of which can be invoked independenetly using make.

* create virtualenv (``make venv``)
* install solr (``make install_solr``)
* setup coverstore (``make setup_coverstore``)
* setup openlibrary webapp (``make setup_ol``)

Destroying the dev instance
---------------------------

You want to destroy the current dev instance to build a new one, you can do it using::

	$ make destroy
	
Running the dev instance
------------------------

Running the dev instance requires running 2 services. Solr is run the background as daemon and the the ol webapp is run in the foreground.

The Solr processes can be started and stopped using `solr.sh` script.::

	$ ./scripts/solr.sh start
	Starting Solr
	Done. Output is logged to var/log/solr.log.
	
	$ ./scripts/solr.sh status
	Solr running with pid 97208.

	$ ./scripts/solr.sh stop
	Stopping Solr
	Done
	
	$ ./scripts/solr.sh status
	Solr is not running
	
The OL webapp can be started as::

	$ make run
	
Make sure Solr is running before starting the webapp.
	
Once the webapp is started, the website can be accessed at http://0.0.0.0:8080/.

Loading sample data
-------------------

Use the `copydocs.py` script to load sample records from openlibrary.org website.::

	$ make load_sample_data

Make sure both Solr and the webapp are running before running this.

Restart the webapp to see the books on homepage.
